# Unit Testing

## Overview

The foundation-testing package is a comprehensive framework for implementing Unit Tests. Use it to ensure that your Genesis Web Application provides a seamless user experience by testing components, functions and user interactions across various scenarios.

---

## Key tools and features:

- **Customizable Unit Test Suites**: Manage and create detailed test suites in the **tests/unit** folder, focusing on critical components and functions. These test suites are fully customizable by default, so you can cover all different parts of the application.
- **Sinon integration**: Use Sinon.JS to incorporate test spies, stubs and mocks into your Unit Tests.
- **Very lightweight**: The test framework provided by foundation-testing is very lightweight and contains [minimal dependencies](https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/uvu).
- **Extremely performant**: Much faster than competing test runners, see [benchmarks](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu/tree/master#benchmarks).
- **Individually executable test files**: You can keep your tests suites organized by splitting them into multiple files (optional).
- **Browser-compatible**: You can easily run and debug your tests in a browser environment, which allows you to use browser developer tools.
