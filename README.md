# uiexamples

This project has been created from the Genesis Blank Application Seed. Our seeds allow users to quickly bootstrap
their projects. Each seed adheres to strict Genesis best practices, and has passed numerous performance, compliance and
accessibility checks. 

Example Application for showing the possibilities in the front end

# Introduction

This application is set up to show the power of the Genesis front end, with multiple UI's shown, with links to the
corresponding code.
The back end is purposely kept simple, with little functionality.  It contains:
1. Static data tables for Entity and Client
2. Trade table with 10 pre-loaded trades
3. Kafka topic subscription for FX Rates, to show ticking data in the front end
4. Time series data of inflation rates for use in charting

The login is admin / genesis
