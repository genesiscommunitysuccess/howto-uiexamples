/**
  * This file defines the views for this application. Views provide a way to
  * create a view across entities which are more friendly, for example joining a
  * trade to an instrument to provide the details of the instrument for
  * presentation next to the trade.
  *
  * Views also allow for the addition of dynamic columns calculated in real time.
  * 
  * Views may be used across the system including as inputs to consolidators,
  * expose as APIs in the request response server as snapshots of data or as real
  * time ticking APIs in the data server.

  * Full documentation on views may be found here >> https://learn.genesis.global/docs/database/fields-tables-views/views/
